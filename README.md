CSCE 3600: Systems Programming
Major Assignment 1 – The Shell and System Calls

COLLABORATION:
  You should complete this assignment as a group assignment with the other members of
  your group. Each group should have 3 or 4 members, no more, no less. Submit only
  ONE program per group. Also, make sure that you list the names of all group members
  who participated in this assignment in order for each to get credit.

GOALS:
  There are four objectives to this assignment:
    • The familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment;
    • To develop programming skills in C;
    • To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells; and
    • To learn how processes are handled (i.e., starting and waiting for their termination).

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
       In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter or shell. The shell
  should operate in in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its
  prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and
  then prompts for more input when it has finished.
  The shell that you implement will be similar to, but much simpler than, the one you run
  in everyday UNIX/Linux. You can find out which shell you are running by typing echo
  $SHELL at a prompt. You may then wish to look at the man pages for bash to learn
  about all of the functionality that can be present. For this project, you do not need to
  implement much functionality, but you will need to be able to handle running multiple
  commands simultaneously.

  Your shell can be run in two ways: (1) interactive and (2) batch. In interactive mode,
  you will display a prompt (any string of your choosing) and the user of the shell will type
  in a command at the prompt. In batch mode, your shell is started by specifying a batch
  file on its command line. The batch file contains the list of commands that should be
  executed. In batch mode, you should not display a prompt. In batch mode, you should
  echo each line you read from the batch file back to the user before executing it. This will
  help you when you debug your shells. In both interactive and batch mode, your shell
  stops accepting new commands when it sees the quit command on a line or reaches
  the end of the input stream (i.e., the end of the batch file or the user types ‘Ctrl-D’).
  The shell should then exit after all running processes have terminated.

  Each line (of the batch file or typed at the prompt) may contain multiple commands
  separated with the semi-colon (;) character. Each of the command separated by a ;
  should be run simultaneously, or concurrently. Note that this is different behavior than
  standard UNIX/Linux shells that run these commands one at a time, in order. The shell
  should not print the next prompt or take more input until all of these commands have 
  finished executing (the wait() and/or waitpid() system calls may be useful
  here). For example, the following lines are all valid and have reasonable commands
  specified:
  
  prompt> ls
  prompt> /bin/ls
  prompt> ls –l
  prompt> ls –l; cat file1
  prompt> ls –l; cat file1; grep Dallas file2
  prompt> ls –l | wc; cat file1

  For example, on the last line, the commands ls –l, cat file, and grep
  Dallas file2 should all be running at the same time. As a result, you may see
  that their output is intermixed. You must support pipes (i.e., |) to connect the output of
  one program to the input of another as in the last command above.
  To exit the shell, the user can type quit. This should just exit the shell and be done
  with it (the exit() system call will be useful here). Note that quit is a built-in shell
  command. It is not to be executed like other programs the user types in. If the quit
  command is on the same line with other commands, you should ensure that the other
  commands execute (and finish) before you exit your shell.
  These are all valid examples for quitting the shell:
  prompt> quit
  prompt> quit; cat file1
  prompt> cat file1; quit
  
  Although most of the commands that users type at the prompt are the name of other
  UNIX/Linux programs, such as ls or more, shells recognize some special commands
  called internal commands that are not program names. For example, the exit
  command terminates the shell, and the cd command changes the current working
  directory. Shells directly make system calls to execute these commands, instead of
  forking a child process to handle them. In addition to creating a shell that knows how to
  launch new programs, your shell will also recognize two internal commands (exit and
  cd) that work by calling existing system calls, exit and chdir.
  Writing your shell in a simple manner is a matter of finding the relevant library routines
  and calling them properly.

REQUIREMENTS:
    Your C program must be invoked exactly as follows: 
       shell [batchFile]
    The command line arguments to your shell are to be interpreted as follows:
    • batchFile: an optional argument (indicated by square brackets as above). If
      present, your shell will read each line of the batchFile for commands to be
      executed. If not present, your shell will run in interactive mode by printing a
      prompt to the user at stdout and reading the command stdin.
      For example, if you run your program as:
      
      shell /home/mat0299/csce3600/batchfile
      
      then it will read commands from /home/mat0299/csce3600/batchfile until
      it sees the quit command.
      
      Defensive programming is an important concept in operating systems: an OS cannot
      simply fail when it encounters an error. It must check all parameters before it trusts
      them. In general, there should be no circumstances in which your C program will core
      dump, hang indefinitely, or prematurely terminate. Therefore, your program must
      respond to all input in a reasonable manner. By “reasonable”, this means that you
      should print a meaningful and understandable error message and either continue
      processing or exit, depending upon the situation.
      
    You should consider the following situations as errors – in each case, your shell should
    print a message to stderr and exit gracefully:
    
      • An incorrect number of command line arguments to your shell program; and
      • The batch file does not exist or cannot be opened.
      For the following situation, you should print a message to the user (stderr) and
      continue processing:
      • A command does not exist or cannot be executed.
      Optionally, to make coding your shell easier, you may print an error message and
      continue processing in the following situation:
      • A very long command line (for this project, over 512 characters including the
      “\n”).
      Your shell should also be able to handle the following scenarios, which are not errors
      (i.e., your shell should not print an error message):
      • An empty command line;
      • Extra white spaces within a command line; and
      • Batch file ends without quit command or user types ‘Ctrl-D’ as command in
      interactive mode.

    In no case should any input or any command line format cause your shell program to
    crash or exit prematurely. You should think carefully about how you want to handle
    oddly formatted command lines (e.g., lines with no commands between a semi-colon).
    In these cases, you may choose to print a warning message and/or execute some
    subset of the commands. However, in all cases, your shell should continue to execute.

    prompt> ; cat file1 ; grep Dallas file2
    prompt> cat file1 ; ; grep Dallas file2
    prompt> cat file1 ; ls –l ;
    prompt> cat file1 ;;;; ls –l
    prompt> ;; ls –l
    prompt> ;
    
    In addition to the above, your shell should recognize two internal commands: exit and
    cd. exit terminates the shell, i.e., the shell calls the exit() system call or returns
    from main. cd uses the chdir() system call to change to the new directory.
    OPTIONAL SHELL FUNCTIONALITY:
    The shell that you are building is fairly simplistic. For teams who have completed all
    requirements for this program and are looking for an additional challenge, teams may
    add the following optional functionality to gain bonus points added to your team’s overall
    score:
    
    • Add a PATH variable.
    • Add a shell history of previous commands run on the shell.
    • Allow the user to customize the prompt.
    
    However, all required functionality must be implemented prior to attempting this extra
    credit work as no points will be given for attempting this functionality if all requirements
    have not been completed. In other words, make sure your program is complete before
    attempting this extra credit.
    
    GRADING:
    This assignment must be submitted via Blackboard with the following elements:
    • Your code should be well documented in terms of comments. For example, good
    comments in general consist of a header (with your name, course section, date,
    and brief description), comments for each variable, and commented blocks of
    code.
    • A README file with some basic documentation about your code. This file should
    contain the following four components:
    o Your name(s).
    5
    o Design Overview: A few paragraphs describing the overall structure of
    your code and any important structures.
    o Complete Specification: Describe how you handled any ambiguities in the
    specification. For example, for this project, explain how your shell will
    handle lines that have no commands between semi-colons.
    o Known Bugs or Problems: A list of any features that you did not implement
    or that you know are not working correctly.
    • A Makefile for compiling your source code, including a clean directive.
    • Your program will be graded based largely on whether it works correctly on the
    CSE machines (e.g., cse01, cse02, …, cse06), so you should make sure that
    your program compiles and runs on a CSE machine.
    To ensure that your C code is compiled correctly, you will need to create a simple
    Makefile. This allows our scripts to just run make to compile your code with the right
    libraries and flags. If you do not know how to write a Makefile, you may reference
    the man pages for make or read the accompanying tutorial for this assignment. Here is
    a sample Makefile that may help as well:
    
    
################################################################
#
# shell.c is the name of your source code; you may change this.
# However, you must keep the name of the executable as "shell".
#
# Type "make" or "make shell" to compile your code
#
# Type "make clean" to remove the executable (and object files)
#
################################################################
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -g
shell: shell.c
$(CC) -o shell $(CFLAGS) shell.c
clean:
$(RM) shell
Your program will be tested using a suite of about 20 test cases on the CSE machines,
some of which will exercise your program’s ability to correctly execute commands and
some of which will test your program’s ability to catch error conditions. Be sure that you
thoroughly exercise your program’s capabilities on a wide range of test suites.
